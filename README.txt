FRAMEWORK:
We used the bootstrap framework.

We have used some downloaded resources:
	jquery.js;
	bootstrap-dropdownhover.js;
	bootstrap-dropdownhover.css;
	animate.css;
This last javascript file is a pre-prepared script to animate the dropdown menu.
We have downloaded and used also the twitter api and to do so we had to download all the twitterouath files.
We have used the google map api and no further script was downloaded for it.

To select the colors for the main navbar we used the tool at page http://work.smarchal.com/twbscolor/ that generates for us the first-nvbar.css that we slightly modified.

TEMPLATES:
We have not used any templates.
